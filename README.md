Our ai detects criminals through cctv's by scanning faces constantly and  comparing with the "wanted" criminals in our dataset.
     - our project starts with face detection first, and recognizes that there is fface while putting a green rectangle around the face (and we adjusted the webcam to move with the face
     - our cctv input is called 'anchor' and shuffles through the folders in our dataset 
     - if the person in the anchor footage doesn't match with anyone in the 'criminal' part of the dataset, so the data in the anchor is deleted because it is in fact a temporary storage 
     - when an criminal is identified, an SMS is sent to police officer numbers (authorities) and the photos in the anchor are saved to the folder of the criminal
